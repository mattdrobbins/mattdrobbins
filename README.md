## Bonjour ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2016 with a degree in Physics and Mathematics. I've been working in software ever since...

I finished up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in 2024 to upgrade my compilers skills. 

My primary interest are in languages, both compiled and spoken.

For compiled languages i've spent much of my career working with C# and .NET. However more recently i've much enjoyed working in OCaml:
- Current OCaml compiler port to .NET [IronCaml](https://github.com/mattdrobbins/IronCaml)
- OCaml JSON Parser [Parser](https://github.com/mattdrobbins/ocaml_json_parser)

Je parle franÃ§ais et anglais et un jour je voudrais Ãªtre polyglotte.

I have worked most recently on a startup focused on bringing language learning and collaboration to the masses.
